## Coding a Website in JavaScript

These files (from `1.html` to `5.html` contain the source code for a practical
group session building a multi-user web application in JavaScript.

If you're taking part in the session and want to get started, then you
probably want to [download the files][] and copy the contents of `2.html`
into your text editor as a starting point to writing some JavScript code.
I'd really recommend you re-write your own app, using `2.html` as a starting
point, rather than just copying the rest of the files).

For more information about the tools used, see [Firebase][] and [AngularJS][].
